# sfTimeSpentPlugin

This symfony plugin is a (right now) really quick-and-dirty plugin for managing the time I spend on the projects I work on. In The Netherlands all enterpreneurs are required to register all the hours they spend on their company. This plugin will allow simply registration of these hours.

The plugin is still under heavy development. Any changes/improvements are welcome :)
